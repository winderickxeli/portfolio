        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <h3>My first steps</h3>
        <p>Those are the first words most of us print on our first development endeavours. For me it was no different at all. More than a decade ago I first learned programming with Visual Basic for Applications.These measly few steps were enough to make me change my educational course from a Economics focus to an IT focus.</p>

        <p>Having spend several years training with Visual Basic, I was ready for High school College. Here we learned the basics in Object Oriented Programming with Java and some PHP for web development. Although these lessons never bored me, I found that I had a better feeling for system administration. After I finished my System Administration education, I was able to start as a Service desk administrator at a local webhosting company called AlfaNet. Honing my skills for several years, I then found it was time for something new, AP High school College.</p>

        <h3>The Jack of all trades</h3>
        <p>My first years at AP were rather uneventful. Yes, we closed some older buildings and we installed some new ones in stead. I always felt I was meant for more than assisting colleagues and students. So I took a change and applied for a system administrator function, which I received. This new function allowed me to grow beyond my foreseen potential. Not only did I administer the client deployment and printing servers, I setup a monitoring system within our department so we’d knew when things would go south.</p>

        <p>Year after year I was able to get more acquainted with all the technologies our department used. Managing and deploying servers became a more prominent role in my function, transforming me more and more into a jack of all trades. A universal toolbox with an endless supply of tools and knowledge.</p>

        <h3>A new beginning</h3>
        <p>As I’m getting older, I’ve grown more experienced at understanding who I am and what I stand for. The ability to create new things rather than reading and executing manuals seem to be an important factor. Due to my many years of excellent work and collaborate teamplay, I was given an excellent opportunity; to study at our High school college and retake some programming steps I had almost forgotten. Starting with SQL and Typescript I regained some of my long lost passion for development and I plotted my course for a new adventure; a coding job.</p>

        <p>Now having learned to work with many concepts such as ‘Test Driven Development’, ‘MVC framework’ and ‘React Framework’, I feel as confined as ever that I’m ready for the next big step, becoming an actual developer.</p>
